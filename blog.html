                <p>The Web Storage API consists of two mechanisms: sessionStorage and localStorage. Both sessionStorage and localStorage
                maintain a separate storage area for each available origin for the duration of the page session.
                
                The main difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that sessionStorage only maintains a storage area while
                the browser is open (including when the page reloads or restores) while localStorage continues to store data after the
                browser is closed. In other words, whereas data stored in sessionStorage is cleared when the page is closed, data stored
                in localStorage does not expire.</p>

                <h2 class="red">Global Scope Vs. Block Scope</h2>
                <p><span class="green bold">Global Scope:</span> The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope.
                Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state
                can access that variable.</p>
                <p><span class="green bold">Block Scope:</span> A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible
                within that particular condition or loop. To be consise the variables declared inside the curly braces are called as
                within block scope.</p>

                <h2 class="red">What is Event Loop?</h2>
                <p>The event loop is an architectural design pattern that allows code to run asynchronously on the javascript engines and
                makes it possible for code to execute blocking instructions first and when available execute asynchronous functions.</p>

                <h2 class="red">When do we get undefined in JavaScript?</h2>
                <p>A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns undefined if the
                variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not
                returned.</p>
